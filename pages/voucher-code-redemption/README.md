# Redeem promo codes with Voucherify <a id="voucherify-example"></a>


This sample shows how to integrate with the [Redeem-Voucher endpoint](https://docs.voucherify.io/reference/redeem-voucher). Validating and accepting promo codes at checkout might be tricky — calculating order total, error message handling, and localization are just a few things to think about when building a simple promo code redemption flow.

This is where the [Voucherify promotion engine](https://docs.voucherify.io/docs) kicks in. Together with our [Promo UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1100356622702326488) you can quickly build the best promotion experience for your customers.

This example is built on top of an online coffee shop with many voucher codes and campaigns available.

The demo is running with a [Sandbox project](https://docs.voucherify.io/docs/testing). Sandbox comes with several test vouchers you can apply in the checkout, e.g.:

``FREE-SHIPPING`` - You find it in your [Vouchers](https://docs.voucherify.io/docs/vouchers-1) dashboard but if there is not Free Shipping Voucher you have to create code with free shipping on [Sandbox](https://docs.voucherify.io/docs/free-shipping-discount)

``BLCKFRDY`` ``50%OFF`` and many other vouchers you find in your [Sandbox](https://docs.voucherify.io/docs/free-shipping-discount) > Vouchers.

Some codes have [validation rules](https://docs.voucherify.io/docs/validation-rules) or different [discount effects](https://docs.voucherify.io/docs/discount-effects) so do not use them or you will not be charged a discount.

The promo code box accepts Amount and Percentage [discount types](https://docs.voucherify.io/docs/vouchers-1#discount-coupons), more coming soon. 

This sample calls two endpoints:

* [Validate voucher code](https://docs.voucherify.io/reference/validate-voucher) — checks the code against [validation rules](https://docs.voucherify.io/docs/validation-rules) and returns calculated discounts.
* [Redeem voucher code](https://docs.voucherify.io/reference/redeem-voucher) — runs validation and then marks the voucher as used. After click redemption button you should see message "Voucher redemeed" - that means your redemption process was successfull.
