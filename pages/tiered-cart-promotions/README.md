# Tiered cart promotions with Voucherify <a id="voucherify-example"></a>

This sample shows how to reward customers by adding rewards for more money spent. We can achieve that solution thanks to [Validate-Promotion-Tier](https://docs.voucherify.io/reference/validate-promotions-1) and [Redeem-Promotion endpoints](https://docs.voucherify.io/reference/redeem-stacked-discounts).

Validating and accepting promo codes in your checkout from scratch might be tricky — calculating discounted prices, error message handling, and localization are just a few things to think about when building a simple promo code redemption flow.

This is where the [Voucherify promotion engine](https://docs.voucherify.io/docs) kicks in. Together with our [Promo UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1100356622702326488) you can quickly build the best promotion experience for your customers.

This example is built on top of an online coffee shop with many voucher codes and campaigns available.

The demo is running with a [Sandbox project](https://docs.voucherify.io/docs/testing). Sandbox comes with test a campaign "Rewards promotion" - ```will be added soon with the creation of an account on Voucherify``` which you will be able to use in your example. At this moment you can add your own [reward campaign](https://support.voucherify.io/article/519-create-cart-level-promotions). If you want your campaign to work with this example you have to give the same campaign name and properties of promotion tiers like below.

```In this example applying coupons is not possible.```

This sample calls two endpoints:

* [Validate promotion](https://docs.voucherify.io/reference/validate-promotions-1) - check if any [promotion tier](https://docs.voucherify.io/docs/promotion-tier) exists.
* [Redeem rewards](https://docs.voucherify.io/reference/redeem-stacked-discounts) — runs validation and then marks the rewards as used. After clicking the redemption button you should see the message "Rewards redeemed" - that means your redemption process was successful.
